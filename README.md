# List of world countries
This code prases country lists from http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000500.htm and puts them to structured map for later use.
This code quite the same as my gist https://gist.github.com/892032 except that its written in clojure and has some extra features - maps all the columns instead of just country code and name.
Tested with LT and EN languages.

## Usage
Install leiningen and type "lein test" to run tests to see whether it works.
